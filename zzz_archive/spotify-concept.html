Even though I was already a senior at the time, this was my first real case study and introduction to product design.</p>
        
                <p>I chose to redesign Spotify because I really loved how much it had transformed my own streaming experience and wanted to make it even better for other users, if possible. Throughout my case study, I followed the Double Diamond methodology.</p>

                <p>To get a better understanding of how users generally felt about using Spotify's mobile app, I first conducted a few contextual inquiry interviews with both Freemium and Premium users. I asked some basic questions like when and how often they used Spotify and what they were most satisfied and frustrated by.</p>
        
                <p>It wasn't long before I noticed a trend – <strong>the majority of my Freemium users were most frustrated with features that Premium solves while Premium users were most satisfied by those very solutions</strong>.</p>

                <p>I looked into other music streaming apps like Tidal, Google Music, and iTunes and Apple Music and was surprised to find that none of them readily allowed users to better organize and maintain the songs in their playlists either.</p>
    
                <p><strong>This might be because most mobile users are on-the-go and seem unlikely to be cleaning out songs.</strong></p>

                <p>However, because Spotify users actually use the mobile app a lot, even to the point of controlling their music on multiple devices at a time, and because sorting songs is a feature already available on both mobile and desktop apps, <strong>I believed that this people problem was still valid and pretty feasible to resolve</strong>.

                <h3>Considering different flows to remove songs</h3>
        
                <p>I also explored a few flows for removing the sick-of songs that the sorting feature helps users find.</p>

                <img class="trigger" data-modal="flows" src="images/spotify-concept/flows.png">
                <p class="caption">

        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-third column">
                <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>I recruited a few users to test my prototypes.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <h3>Intriguing users with (visible) sorting feature</h3>

                <p>Everyone seemed to find my sorting feature intriguing because they (once again) did not know that Spotify already has its own sorting feature.</p>

                <p>My users were also all able to easily find the different entry points for sorting, which was one of my main goals.</p>
        
                <br><br>

                <h3>Flustering users with "mathy" and "clustered" feature</h3>

                <p>My users pointed out, however, that:</p>

                <div class="indented-item">
                    <ul>
                        <li>the wording of the sorting options was very confusing</li>
                        <li>the number of skips and plays was interesting information but may not need to be at the forefront</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4><span class="quote">“</span>I like the function but I hate doing the math and staring at the ratios myself. It's also kinda cluttered here.<span class="quote">”</span> –KL</h4>

                <h4><span class="quote">“</span>I'm not sure what the difference between sorting by plays/skips and skips/plays is.<span class="quote">”</span> –SH</h4>

                <p>I also got feedback that the sorting arrows were not really intuitive.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-third column">
                <h2>Iterating</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <h3>Narrowing down on entry point(s)</h3>

                <p>In my iteration process, I first narrowed down on using the sort button and the ellipses button as my entry points.</p>

                <p>For both the sorting user flow and the deleting user flow, my users didn't seem to like the last entry points as much.</p>

                <h4><span class="quote">“</span>The third one was less intuitive because what I look for is Recently Played not Recently Skipped.<span class="quote">”</span> –JB</h4>

                <h4><span class="quote">“</span>I usually just close pop-ups.<span class="quote">”</span> –SH</h4>

                <br><br>

                <h3>Iterating on play vs. skip information</h3>

                <p>I then moved all the numbers from the playlist screen to the individual song pages. This way, the playlist screen was less clustered but users could still view the numbers if they wanted to.</p>
        
                <p>I also changed “number of plays/skips” and “number of skips/plays” to “number of plays” and “number of skips” so that the feature was more intuitive.</p>
        
                <br><br>
        
                <h3>Looking for visual design inspiration on sorting feedback</h3>
        
                <p>I then spent some time looking at non-music streaming apps for more visual design inspiration on sorting and filtering.</p>
        
                <p>Specifically, I wanted to see how other apps provide feedback on whether or not a list of items is sorted and in what order.</p>
        
                <p>I was inspired by Uplift and Amazon.</p>

                <h3>Finalizing and justifying final user flow</h3>

                <p>My final interaction flow thus allows users to sort a personal playlist by clicking either the “Sort by” button or the playlist options “…” button. After sorting, they can click into a specific song to see its statistics and remove it from the current playlist.</p>

                <p><strong>This interaction flow solves my people problem because it gives users control in organizing and maintaining their personal playlists.</strong> Specifically, it takes advantage of Spotify’s existing feature and improves on it so that users no longer need to spend a lot of time to see which songs they should remove from their personal playlists.</p>

                <p>Looking back, I know that there are a ton of solution spaces that I would have loved to explore given more time, user research, and feedback from both users and other designers.</p>

                <p>Still, I am really proud of this case study because it introduced me to the joy and value of product design; I especially loved brainstorming with my friends and thinking of different entry points for my design solution.</p>
        
                <p>To become a designer and work in a team with other designers (and engineers and product managers and writers and researchers) would truly be a dream come true 💜.</p>
